## Problem Statement
--- This project aims to pick apart and analyze the State Estimates of Substance Use and Mental Disorders found through the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Currently, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) distributes grants heavily based on population distribution. I am aiming to analyze deaths caused by drug and alcohol use in order to identify risk and see what states are in need of a higher treatment/grant rate. In addition, I aim to use acquired data from SAMHSA to provide other possible factors when distributing grants. By doing so, this project will be able to help identify areas at risk.
